# Cramer's Rule Implementation

This is a Python implementation of **Cramer's Rule** to solve systems of linear equations. It uses the `NumPy` library for efficient matrix operations and provides step-by-step outputs including matrices D, Dx, and Dy.

## üßÆ Features

- Solves systems of **2 or 3 variable equations** (if a unique solution exists)
- Displays matrix steps (D, Dx, Dy)
- Simple and clean CLI-based interface

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** NumPy

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

This script can be used to solve equations of two or three variables. You just need to input coefficients and constants, and the program handles the rest.

```bash
python cramers_rule.py
```
