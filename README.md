# Crammer's Rule Implementation

This is the python implementation of Crammer's rule. I've used 'Numpy' library.
## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Modules Used:** Numpy

# Cramer's Rule Implementation

This is a Python implementation of **Cramer's Rule** to solve systems of linear equations. It uses the `NumPy` library for efficient matrix operations and provides step-by-step outputs including matrices D, Dx, and Dy.

## üßÆ Features

- Solves systems of **2 or 3 variable equations** (if a unique solution exists)
- Displays matrix steps (D, Dx, Dy)
- Simple and clean CLI-based interface

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** NumPy

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

This script can be used to solve equations of two or three variables. You just need to input coefficients and constants, and the program handles the rest.

'''bash
python cramers_rule.py
'''
